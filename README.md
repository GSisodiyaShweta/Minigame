# SPACECHEM_CMPM_Version

SPACECHEM_CMPM_Version WHAT IS SPACECHEM_CMPM_Version?

SPACECHEM_CMPM_Version is new adaptation of the puzzle game SpaceChem by Zachtronics. In this version you will decode a motion sequence for chemical reactor like "C" and "H"(atoms) into specific sequence like "HCCH"(molecules).

YOUR OBJECTIVE

You must enter a sequence which will be followed by a pointer from START square to an OUT square so the line runs through letters spelling out the sequence of the molecule above the grid. Each START and OUT square may connect to only one line.

VALID LINES

A valid line must start in a START square and end in an OUT square. It must be the only line leaving that START square and the only line entering that OUT square. Generally speaking, a square may only be crossed once by any line. The excution to this is the "double-cross",where a square is crossed straight through in each direction. A line may turn and change direaction in a square but doing so prevants that square from being crossed agian in the future.START and OUT squares may not be crossed.Lines may only leave START sqaures and enter OUT squares
